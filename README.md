# employee-tracker1
For this assignement we were tasked to create a database through my SQL that users can look at and store employee data.

In order to obtain this database, clone my git repository to your local storage, and run "npm i" in the command line in the file directory.

Use this program to keep track of your staff. You can see salary, role, and the employees id number. You can enter/remove employees, departments, and roles. You can also update roles for current employees.
